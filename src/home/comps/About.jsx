          E. J. Mainwaring (the sole member of EJANDTN) writes captivating
          songs, which are brought to life with his unique, rich baritone vocal
          that conjures thoughts of Leonard Cohen and Scott Walker. A singer and
          songwriter born in Liverpool, UK, his music errs on the side of
          melancholia, whilst also still managing to provoke hopeful and
          nostalgic imagery in the process. <br />
          <br />
          Usually accompanied by a band of accomplished musicians weaving the
          intricate instrumentation around his captivating narratives, James
          studies and channels the foundations of songwriting and storytelling
          laid out before him by the likes of Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and John
          Lennon. With a passion for songwriting, his focus is mainly on deeply
          thought-out, spellbinding lyrics and moving instrumentation to deliver
          his unique style of song.
